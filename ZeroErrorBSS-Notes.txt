-description on a BSS machine: BSS machines are able to handle exact descriptions, not "representations of objects",
in contranst to TMs
-different machine model -> different results -> explicit treatment of underlying machine model

-machine ethics

-Starting from this result, we approach the problem from the view of theoretical computer science, 
	with an explicit treatment of the unerlying machine Model: does there exist a Blum-Shub-Smale computable algorithm that solves the above 
	decision problem based on the plant's and DMC's characteristics? Given the rise of digital technology in control and decision-making, 
	questions of this kind are becoming increasingly important, especially with regards to machine ethics and technology assessment. 

Generally, remote and/or distributed decision making is becoming increasingly important in view of future communication networks. The ideas behin well known slogans like``Industry 4.0'', ``Autonomous Driving'', ``Internet of Things'' and the 
	``Metaverse'' are examples for a the currentd trend in communications to shift the focus away from pure data transmission towards interconnecting 
	
	For the upcoming 5G and 6G mobile communication standards,
	explicite requirements regarding hardware trustworthiness and integrity are stated, some of which have been shown to exceed the limitations of today's digital hardware. 
	At the same time, we can observe a recent paradigm shift in research and development towards analog signal processing and computing hardware, summarized under the slogan ``neuromorphic computing''. 
	While the theoretical capabilities of digital hardware
	are precisely captured by the abstract model of Turing machines, a comparable universal model for analog computing has not been widely accepted. 
	A promising candidate for the latter is the \emph{Blum-Shub-Smale} machine, a generalization of the Turing machine that can process exact real numbers. BSS machines have been shown to be more powerful
	than Turing machines in general, with many specific instances of practical relevance. In particular, there are several scenarios in communication where BSS machines are more powerful than Turing machines.
	Hence, BSS machines merit an investigation from the view of theoretical computer science, even if they cannot be practically implementend as of today.



Since the requirements regarding hardware integrity and trustworthiness imposed on future communication networks has been shown
	to reach the fundamental limits of digital hardware, Blum-Shub-Smale machines merit an investigation from the theoretical point of view, even if they cannot be implemented as of today.
